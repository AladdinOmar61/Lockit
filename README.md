# Locked
This app will help you keep track of your locks, combinations, and keys to locks

Ever have an old lock that you havent used in a while and want to remember what combination it
has in order to use it, and dont want to go through the process of resetting the combination
or getting a new lock? This is the app for you

## Keep track of current locks
Take a picture of your new (or old) lock, enter its combination, and it will stay stored in your device!
It is recommended to take a picture of the lock in case you have multiple locks so that you can keep track
of which lock has which combination

## Lock uses a key, but lost your lock? No problem! Just use your saved picture to generate a new one!
Take multiple pictures of your key, so that places like home depot can look at the key pattern and generate
a brand new one in case its lost!

## Enjoy your new life of convenience and time saving with this app that keep track!
Never lose track of your locks again, and always have quick access to your locks to keep your things
safe as soon as possible!
